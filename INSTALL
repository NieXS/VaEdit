How to install
==============

VaEdit uses the waf build system, requiring the Python interpreter to be installed. It depends on
Vala 0.8.0, GTK+ 2.10+ and GtkSourceView 2.10+. The common install procedure is:

$ ./waf configure --prefix=/usr
$ ./waf build

And, with root privileges:

# ./waf install

You can uninstall with "./waf uninstall" as well, again as root.
